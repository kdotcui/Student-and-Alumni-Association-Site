# Student-and-Alumni-Association-Site
A mock "Brandeis Student and Alumni Association" website using Express.js, MongoDB, HTML, and CSS. Has a User database, events/jobs board, and a built-in live chat.

Site visitors can sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out using the user function. All user info is kept in MongoDB.
By signing in, they gain access to an array of functionalities, such as an events page, jobs page, and a life chat page, where they can create new events and jobs with descriptions and enroll in either. MongoDB is used to store "attendees" for events.
The live chat function allows any signed-in users to chat with each other.
